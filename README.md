run_analysis.R does:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the calculated mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Relabels the data set with descriptive variable names, to improve comprehensibility.
* From the data set created, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each pair subject x activity.
